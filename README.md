The Definition of FOSS Licenses
Initially, all FOSS was referred to as free software. The term open source was introduced in 1998 with the intention of clarifying that the software was not free but, instead, gave users more flexibility because the source code was readily available. The definitions of free software and open source software largely align and essentially include the same license terms (see “The Four Essential Freedoms” section for details). To cover both aspects, software licensed under such terms is referred to as FOSS.
Simply put, FOSS licenses are distribution terms for software. They are necessary because software is protected under copyright laws (see the “Protection of Software Under Copyright Law” section). Unless rights of use are granted (licensed, see the “Software Licensing” section), third parties are not in a position where they can lawfully use the software. This applies irrespective of whether software is licensed as FOSS or otherwise (for example, proprietarily), but if software is licensed as FOSS, the distribution terms meet particular requirements (see the “Free and Open Source Licensing” section).
Protection of software under copyright law
In line with model provisions made available by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Geneva, Switzerland, a computer program is “a set of instructions capable, when incorporated in a machine-readable medium, of causing a machine having information-processing capabilities to indicate, perform, or achieve a particular result.” (The model provisions are available at www.wipo.int/mdocsarchives/AGCP_NGO_IV_77/AGCP_NGO_IV_8_E.pdf.) Software is usually referred to as computer programs in the respective legal texts and is widely protected as literary work (the same as books and this article) under applicable copyright law, provided that the software embodies an author’s original creation. This protection was agreed to in the WIPO Copyright Treaty and is, for example, reflected in the United States by the Copyright Act of 1976 and in the European Union by the so-called Computer Programs Directive (Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs) and its integration into member states’ laws (for example, the German Copyright Act).

All rights of use to the software (such as the right to distribute and the right to modification) initially lay with the software developer. Exceptions to this rule may apply depending on the applicable copyright law. For example, in the case of employment relationships, the rights of use may lay with the employer. Third parties (anyone who is not the software developer) may only use the software if, and to the extent that, rights of use are granted (licensed) to them.

Software licensing
Software licensing means that rights of use to computer programs are granted. Such rights may be granted in various ways, including simple/single rights of use with all others having the same privileges or exclusively so that the licensee is the only one who may lawfully exercise a particular right. A license may be territorially restricted (for example, the European Union only) or granted worldwide; it may be restricted in time (such as what happens with hardcover books before they become available as paperbacks), or it may be perpetually granted. Finally, licenses may be granted for varying types of use, including reproduction in whole or in part; translation, adaptation, arrangement, and other modifications; and distribution of a computer program and making software publicly available.

FOSS licensing
These licensing options always exist irrespective of whether software is licensed proprietarily or as FOSS. All FOSS licenses simply make use of these options in a particular way. Rights of use are granted to the furthest extent possible to give users the four essential freedoms detailed in the next section. The rights of use only vary in how they are worded. Some are simple and straightforward, such as the rights-of-use provision in the Berkeley Source Distribution (BSD) licenses, as illustrated by this example from the BSD-2-Clause2:


Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted […].

Others, such as the provision in the MIT license, are more elaborate but still directly worded3:


Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “software”), to deal in the software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, and to permit persons to whom the software is furnished to do so, […].

Yet others, such as the Apache-2.0 license, use more legalese to describe the same, extensive rights of use4:


Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, each contributor hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the work and such derivative works in source or object form.

The four essential freedoms
By extensively granting rights of use, FOSS licenses ensure that users have the freedom to use, study, share, and modify software. Three of these four essential freedoms were first set out in Richard Stallman’s definition of free software, which, after adding freedom zero, the Free Software Foundation (FSF), Boston, still relies on today. (See the FSF’s “What is free software?” article available at https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html. For additional detail, see the FSF’s definition of free software available at www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en#f1.) Accordingly, for software to be considered free, users must be granted the following freedoms:

to run the program as desired for any purpose

to study how the program works and change it so that it performs computing tasks as desired

to redistribute copies

to distribute copies of modified versions, thus giving the whole community a chance to benefit from the changes that were made.

Although the term free software was always intended to reference software liberty and not price, the ambiguity of the word free was widely assumed to prevent the business adoption of FOSS and FOSS licenses. In reaction to such a misconception, the term open source was coined in the late 1990s.
