Simply put, FOSS licenses are distribution terms for software. They are necessary because software is protected under copyright laws (see the “Protection of Software Under Copyright Law” section). Unless rights of use are granted (licensed, see the “Software Licensing” section), third parties are not in a position where they can lawfully use the software. This applies irrespective of whether software is licensed as FOSS or otherwise (for example, proprietarily), but if software is licensed as FOSS, the distribution terms meet particular requirements (see the “Free and Open Source Licensing” section).
